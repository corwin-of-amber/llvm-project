* copied wasi-kernel/include to wasi-include
* added wasi-include/c++/__config

In `llvm`:
* need to first build llvm-tblgen for host:
  mkdir build-x86; cd build-x86; cmake ..; cmake --build . --target llvm-tblgen
* then configure w build-script:
  mkdir build; cd build; ../../build-script; cmake --build . --target llc


Local hacks:
* Path is compiled with -DCOA_BINJI_HACK; need to check about the other BINJI_HACKs.
